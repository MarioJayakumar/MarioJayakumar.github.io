## [Data Visualization and Machine Learning using IMDB Dataset](https://mariojayakumar.com/DataScienceFinalProject/)

This is my data science final project from my Spring 2018 semester at the University of Maryland. Using R techniques learned in class, I created an analysis of the IMDB5000 dataset; this dataset includes information regarding 5000 films from the last 50 years, including revenue, popularity, cast and production company. I performed an exploratory data analysis and used machine learning techniques to predict profitability of a movie.
